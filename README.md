## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - A fast build tool and development server

### What I learned

Because Im doing the proyects with react, Im learning the basic usage of the basic hooks of react like useState, useEffect and understanding the sintax of using it.
Also I want to create another branch to improve the code and use another hook useContext to keep learning.

From tailwind... there are always new things I learned to combine that maybe are not the best but they are very usefull.
